# 1.Declare your age as integer variable
# 2.Declare your height as a float variable
# 3.Declare a variable that store a complex number
# 4.Write a script that prompts the user to enter base and height of the triangle and calculate an area of this triangle (area = 0.5 x b x h).

print ("age: 18")
print ("height: 6.2ft")
print ("the area of the triangle is 100")


# 5.Write a script that prompts the user to enter side a, side b, and side c of the triangle. Calculate the perimeter of the triangle (perimeter = a + b + c).
#Enter side a: 5
#Enter side b: 4
#Enter side c: 3
print ("perimeter = 5+4+3")

#6. Get length and width of a rectangle using prompt. Calculate its area (area = length x width) and perimeter (perimeter = 2 x (length + width))
l = float (input('5'))
b = float (input ('4'))
Area = l*b 

perimeter = 2*(5+4)
print ("area of a rectangle is : %.2f" %Area )
